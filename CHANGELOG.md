# Changelog

All notable changes to ata-validator are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to semantic versioning.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-05-09

### Added

- **`ata build <glob>`** subcommand for project-wide AOT compilation. Compiles each matched schema to a per-file `.compiled.mjs` ESM module with a sibling `.d.mts` TypeScript declaration. Production bundles can drop the runtime ata-validator dependency entirely and import compiled validators as plain ESM modules.
- **`ata-validator/build` programmatic subpath export.** `import { build, watch } from 'ata-validator/build'` exposes the same engine the CLI uses, so build pipelines and bundler plugins can integrate without going through the CLI.
- **CLI flags for `ata build`:** `--out-dir`, `--suffix`, `--format esm|cjs`, `--abort-early`, `--no-types`, `--cache-file`, `--check`, `--watch`, `--max-size`, `--strict`.
- **Incremental cache** via content-hashed `--cache-file`. Second run on unchanged inputs skips compilation.
- **YAML schema support** when the `yaml` peer dependency is installed (optional). `.yaml` and `.yml` inputs parse the same as `.json`.
- **AOT vs AJV-runtime benchmark** at `benchmark/bench_aot_vs_ajv.mjs`. On the included fixtures, ata-AOT outputs are 25-56x smaller gzipped than the AJV runtime, cold start is ~2x faster, throughput is 2-4.5x faster, and compile time is 71-246x shorter.

### Fixed

- **Standalone modules now correctly serialize closure-bound helpers** (RegExp, Set, sub-validator functions, branch-property arrays) into the emitted `.mjs`. Previously, schemas using `patternProperties`, `propertyNames` with regex, or `unevaluatedProperties` with `anyOf`/`oneOf` produced standalone output that referenced undefined variables (`_ppf0_0`, `_re*`, `_es*`, `_bk*`) and threw `ReferenceError` at runtime. The runtime validation path was unaffected.

### Notes

- The runtime `Validator` API and the `ata-validator/compat` AJV-shim remain unchanged. Existing dynamic-schema users have no migration to do.
- Bundler plugins (ata-vite v0.2.0, ata-webpack, ata-codemod-ajv) are out of scope for this release and will land in 0.14.0+.
